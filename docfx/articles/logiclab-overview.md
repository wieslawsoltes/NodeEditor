# LogicLab Overview

LogicLab is the sample digital logic editor built on top of NodeEditor. It demonstrates:

- A domain-specific toolbox and templates.
- Bus-aware pins and connectors.
- Simulation with propagation delays.
- Specialized node content view models for gates, clocks, flip-flops, and buses.

The logic domain is split across two packages:

- `NodeEditorLogic.Core`: core logic types and component library.
- `NodeEditorLogic.Editor`: editor-facing view models and services.

Use LogicLab as a reference for building your own domain-specific node editor.
